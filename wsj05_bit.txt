Japanese companies have long been accused of sacrificing profit to boost sales.
But Fujitsu Ltd. has taken that practice to a new extreme. 
Japan's biggest computer maker last week undercut seven competitors to win a contract to design a mapping system for the city of Hiroshima's waterworks.
Its bid: one yen, or less than a U.S. penny. 
The bid created such a furor that Fujitsu said it is now offering to withdraw from the project. 
"From a common-sense viewpoint, it was not socially acceptable," a Fujitsu spokeswoman said yesterday.
Hiroshima city officials couldn't be reached to find out whether they would drop Fujitsu's bid. 
Fujitsu said it issued the low bid because it wanted a foot in the door of a potentially lucrative market. 
"We desperately wanted the contract because we want experience in the field," the Fujitsu spokeswoman said. 
"We expect a big market in the future, so in the long term it will be profitable.
It's a kind of an investment."
